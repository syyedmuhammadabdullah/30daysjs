// create variable of different types such as number string boolean array object etc and log them in console

//type of number

//create a variable and assign it a value and log it then reassign it a new value and log it again
//assigning value
let variable=10;
console.log(variable);
//reassigning value
variable=20;
console.log(variable);


//try reassigning a variable with the same name as the one you created and observe the error
// do it yourself by creating a variable with the same name as the one you created and try reassigning it with a new value




//create a constant and try to reassign it a value and observe the error
const constant=10;
console.log(constant);
// constant=20;
// console.log(constant);

//you will get error assignment to a constant variable is not allowed
//this means you cannot reassign a constant variable with a new value


//congrats you have completed the first part of this tutorial
